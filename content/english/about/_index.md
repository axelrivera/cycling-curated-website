Iâ€™m a software developer by trade and a passionate cycling enthusiast based in **Orlando, Florida**. Central Florida has one of the best cycling communities in the stateâ€”packed with clubs, group rides, and trails in just about every direction. Within 30 to 45 minutes from downtown, youâ€™ve got access to some of the best cycling routes in Florida.

I started riding in 2020, during the early days of the COVID pandemic, when getting outside was one of the few ways to reset. Like a lot of people, I got hooked fast. But for me, it wasnâ€™t just the freedom of the open trail. It was how cycling made me feel: more present, more focused, more me.

Iâ€™ve been building iOS apps for over 10 years. These days, I focus on health and fitnessâ€”and cycling has become a big part of that. It shows up in the code I write and the apps I build to help people move more, train better, and stay motivated.

**Cycling Curated** is my space to share the rideâ€”without pretending to be something Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m not a coach. I donâ€™t race professionally. Iâ€™m just a fan. A fan who reads a lot about endurance, watches race coverage, and keeps tabs on the latest tech like itâ€™s my job (because, in some ways, it is).

This blog and newsletter are a collection of everything Iâ€™ve found useful, interesting, or just plain cool, from training tips to gear reviews to app ideas that blend fitness with everyday tech. No hype. No ego. Just helpful insights and the occasional nudge to push a little further.

If youâ€™re into cyclingâ€”not just the sport, but the whole ecosystem that comes with itâ€”youâ€™ll feel right at home here.
