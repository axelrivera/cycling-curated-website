I’m Axel Rivera—software developer, cycling enthusiast, and the person behind *Cycling Curated*.

I live in **Orlando, Florida**, right in the heart of one of the best cycling communities in the state. Central Florida is packed with active clubs and plenty of great trails and routes—many of them just a short drive away. It’s a great place to ride, and a big part of what keeps me motivated to stay on the bike year-round.

I got into cycling back in 2020 during COVID, when getting outside felt like a small return to normal. Since then, riding has become a big part of my life. I’m not a coach or a pro racer—just someone who loves the sport, follows the racing scene, reads way too many training articles, and keeps up with the latest gear and tech.

By day, I build iOS apps—mostly in the health and fitness space. I’ve been doing it for over 10 years, and cycling has found its way into a lot of the work I do. Creating *Cycling Curated* felt like a natural next step.

### What You Can Expect

This blog is a companion to the weekly newsletter. Here, I’ll be sharing:

- Highlights from the racing world  
- Training and fitness insights that are actually useful  
- Gear reviews and product launches  
- Tips on tech, maintenance, and cycling apps  
- Occasional thoughts on the culture and community around the sport

I’ll keep things practical, honest, and hopefully worth your time. If you’re into cycling—whether you're just getting started or already planning your next race—I think you’ll find something here for you.

Thanks for riding along.
