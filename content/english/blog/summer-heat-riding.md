Summer’s rolling in fast—and if you’ve been riding long enough, you know the heat doesn’t just change the temperature. It changes the ride.

That first muggy day of the season always catches me off guard. Legs feel heavy, the heart rate spikes faster than usual, and even a familiar route starts to feel unfamiliar. If you’ve ever looked down at your average speed and thought, *“Was I dragging a parachute today?”*, you’re not alone.

So let’s talk about it. Because summer riding is its own thing—and it deserves a different approach.

### Heat Changes the Game

Riding in the heat isn’t just “more of the same with extra sweat.” Your body is working harder even if your pace doesn’t show it. The heat makes your heart rate climb, it makes recovery slower, and it zaps your hydration quicker than you’d expect. Even seasoned riders get surprised by how much it takes out of them.

That doesn’t mean you’re out of shape or having a bad day. It just means the weather showed up to play defense.

### Shift the Goalposts (And That’s a Good Thing)

When summer hits, I stop chasing numbers and start chasing habits.

Instead of pushing to beat a segment or hit a certain average speed, I focus on:

- **Staying consistent** (showing up for the ride, not just crushing it)  
- **Listening to my body** (using heart rate or just good ol’ perceived effort)  
- **Hydrating like it’s a job**

The goal isn’t to “do less”—it’s to do it differently. You’re still building fitness, but now it’s about staying steady and smart instead of burning out before July.

### Train Smarter, Not Hotter

Here’s what helps me get through the summer months without melting:

- **Ride early or late.** Midday rides? Hard pass. I love a sunrise spin before the pavement heats up or a golden-hour cruise to wrap the day.
- **Bring more water than you think you need.** I usually pack a second bottle with electrolytes—and if I’m out for long, I plan a stop to refill or grab something cold.
- **Slow down. Really.** Your body’s already working harder. Let the pace ease up, especially on climbs.
- **Dress light.** Summer gear should breathe. Lightweight jerseys, a cap under the helmet, and sunscreen on anything that’s not covered.

### Know When to Call It

This part’s important. You’re not being “soft” for cutting a ride short if the heat’s too much.

Watch for:

- Dizziness  
- Cramps  
- Chills (ironically, a bad sign when it’s hot)  
- Or that sense that something’s just off

No ride is worth heat exhaustion. Seriously.

### Summer’s Got Its Perks Too

I know I’ve made it sound like summer’s out to ruin your fun—but there’s plenty to love too.

The longer days open up evening ride options. There are more group rides, more casual events, and more excuses to explore new routes with shade, water stops, or a café at the halfway point. And let’s be honest—there’s something satisfying about finishing a sweaty ride and absolutely earning that cold drink.

Plus, training in the heat builds a quiet kind of strength. If you learn how to ride through the tough stuff, cooler days feel like a reward.

### Final Thoughts: Ride the Season, Don’t Fight It

You don’t need to power through every summer ride like it’s a test. Instead, take it as a chance to build consistency, pay attention to your body, and ride with a little more ease.

The speed and stamina will come. For now, just keep showing up.

_Stay cool out there!_
